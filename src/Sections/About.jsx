          I am a student at the Informatics Engineering Department of Universitas Negeri Semarang, where I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree. My primary focus is on web development, an area that I am deeply passionate about. I am committed to honing my skills in designing and building innovative web applications that can make a meaningful impact in today's digital landscape.<br/><br/>
          In addition to web development, I am also interested in exploring the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I believe that these technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, and I am eager to learn more about them.<br/><br/>
          Recently, I had the opportunity to apply my web development skills in a real-world project. I was part of a team that developed a website for a campus organization, where I was responsible for designing and implementing the frontend for the projects page. This experience not only helped me to improve my coding skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving a common goal.
